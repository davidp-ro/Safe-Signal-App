If we didn't have access to your location people would find you much harder.\n    We need Bluetooth permissions so the app can interact with the bracelet. This will not affect other devices such as Bluetooth headphones or anything else.\n    We need permission for your Contacts app so we can save which contacts you want the app to send messages to when you are in danger.\n    We need SMS permissions so the app can send messages to the authorities and close contacts when you are in danger. A bunch of pop ups will appear asking you for every aforementioned permission but don't worry, now you know why!",
